   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

AB Pagination
=============

AB Pagination adds a lot of flexibility and power to the default {exp:channel:entries} pagination functionality in ExpressionEngine.

Benefits
--------
Some benefits over the standard EE pagination functionality:

* Total control, you can skin it any way you want
* Conditionals for has_previous, has_next etc. available
* A lot of tags available for all kinds of different use-cases - can't solve a specific pagination case? Let us know!
* The link to the first first page won't be postfixed with /P0 .. linking to /P0 basically creates duplicate content in Google, which is bad for SEO

Contents:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

 installation
 settings
 tags




Indices and tables
==================

* :ref:`genindex`
* :ref:`modindex`
* :ref:`search`
