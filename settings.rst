Settings
========

AB Pagination has a single setting that lets you modify the tag prefix. By default it it set to "abp\_". Changing it will modify all variables mentioned in this documentation (all conditionals, all variables). If you rename it from "abp\_" to "myprefix\_" for instance, {if abp_has_next} becomes {if myprefix_has_next} etc.
